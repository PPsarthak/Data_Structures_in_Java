# Data_Structures_in_Java 
This my GitHub Repo to store all my files related to Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main packages: dataStructures and dynamicProgramming.

### Data Structures
The dataStructures package contains essential data structures implemented in Java. Here are the files included:

#### Graph: Graph representation and common graph algorithms.
#### BinaryTree: Binary tree structure and traversal algorithms.
#### BinarySearchTree: Binary search tree implementation.
#### AVL Trees: AVL tree for balanced binary search trees.
#### SegmentTree: Segment tree for range queries.
#### FenwickTree: Fenwick tree for efficient prefix sum calculations.
#### DisjointSet: Disjoint set (Union-Find) data structure.
#### Trie: Trie data structure for efficient string operations.
#### SingleyLinkedList: Implementation of a singly linked list.

### Dynamic Programming
The dynamicProgramming package further categorizes dynamic programming algorithms into subpackages based on their similarities:

#### DP1D: One-dimensional DP problems.
#### DP2D: Two-dimensional DP problems.
#### DP3D: Three-dimensional DP problems.
#### strings: DP problems related to strings.
#### subsets: Problems involving subsets.
#### stocks: DP problems related to stock trading.
#### grids: DP problems on grids.
#### lis: DP problems for the longest increasing subsequence problem.
#### partition: Problems related to partition DP.

### Algorithms
In addition to data structures, the src folder includes various algorithm implementations directly. These include popular algorithms like:

#### Boyer's Moore Majority Voting: An algorithm for finding the majority element in a sequence.
#### Kadane: Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum.
#### Interpolation Search: A searching algorithm for ordered datasets.
#### Power Set: Generating all subsets of a set.
#### Quick Select: An algorithm for finding the k-th smallest/largest element in an unordered list.
#### Quick Sort: Efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
#### Merge Sort: Sorting algorithm that uses the merge approach.
#### and other sorting algorithms and much more
